# secDIM: A framework for Secure Distributed Identity Management
semDIM is a novel approach for distributed identity management based on a Semantic Web architecture.
semDIM provides for the first time a mechanism for a distributed definition and management of entities such as persons (working in an organization), groups, and roles.
Research about semDIM is published at [under Review].
This page provides the .owl-files as well as the source code of a demonstration implementation.
